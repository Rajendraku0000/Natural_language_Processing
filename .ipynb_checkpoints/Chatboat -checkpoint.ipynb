    "# What is a Chatbot?\n",
    "A Chatbot is an AI application that mimics human conversations. It is widely used by companies to solve the most common problems they receive from customers daily. For example, if you want to know the CRN of your bank account, a chatbot will assist you by asking for your bank details, then it will give you your CRN. But if you want to know something that is not that common, like asking how you can turn your account into a joint account, chances are the authorized employee will assist you.\n",

    "So while creating a chatbot for any company you should know what that company deals in and what problems their customers get daily. In the section below, I will take you through how to create a chatbot using Python."
