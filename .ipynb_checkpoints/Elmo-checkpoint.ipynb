    "What is word embeddings?\n",
    "It is the representation of words into vectors. These vectors capture important information about the words such that the words sharing the same neighborhood in the vector space represent similar meaning. There are various methods for creating word embeddings, for example, Word2Vec,  Continuous Bag of Words(CBOW), Skip Gram, Glove, Elmo, etc.\n",

    "Embeddings from Language Models(ELMo) :\n",
    "(1). ELMo is an NLP framework developed by AllenNLP. ELMo word vectors are calculated using a two-layer bidirectional language model (biLM). Each layer comprises forward and backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). Unlike Glove and Word2Vec, ELMo represents embeddings for a word using the complete sentence containing that word. Therefore, ELMo embeddings are able to capture the context of the word used in the sentence and can generate different embeddings for the same word used in a different context in different sentences.\n",
